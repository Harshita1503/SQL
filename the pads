Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

SELECT concat(NAME, CASE WHEN occupation = "Doctor" THEN "(D)" WHEN occupation = "Professor" THEN "(P)" WHEN occupation = "Singer" THEN "(S)" WHEN occupation = "Actor" THEN "(A)" END )
FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY NAME; SELECT "There are a total of", COUNT(OCCUPATION), concat(LOWER(OCCUPATION),"s.") FROM OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION) ASC, OCCUPATION ASC;
